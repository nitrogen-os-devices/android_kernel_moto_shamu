	bool "BAM Data Mux Driver"
	depends on SPS
	help
	  Support Muxed Data Channels over BAM interface.
	  BAM has a limited number of pipes.  This driver
	  provides a means to support more logical channels
	  via muxing than BAM could without muxing.

config MSM_IPC_ROUTER_SMD_XPRT
	depends on MSM_SMD
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM SMD XPRT Layer"
	help
	  SMD Transport Layer that enables IPC Router communication within
	  a System-on-Chip(SoC). When the SMD channels become available,
	  this layer registers a transport with IPC Router and enable
	  message exchange.

config MSM_IPC_ROUTER_HSIC_XPRT
	depends on USB_QCOM_IPC_BRIDGE
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM HSIC XPRT Layer"
	help
	  HSIC Transport Layer that enables off-chip communication of
	  IPC Router. When the HSIC endpoint becomes available, this layer
	  registers the transport with IPC Router and enable message
	  exchange.

config MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	depends on QMI_ENCDEC
	bool "MSM QMI Interface Library"
	help
	  Library to send and receive QMI messages over IPC Router.
	  This library provides interface functions to the kernel drivers
	  to perform QMI message marshaling and transport them over IPC
	  Router.

config MSM_RPM_RBCPR_STATS_V2_LOG
	tristate "MSM Resource Power Manager RPBCPR Stat Driver"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option enables v2 of the rpmrbcpr_stats driver which reads RPM
	  memory for statistics pertaining to RPM's RBCPR(Rapid Bridge Core
	  Power Reduction) driver. The drivers outputs the message via a
	  debugfs node.

config MSM_RPM_LOG
	tristate "MSM Resource Power Manager Log Driver"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	depends on MSM_RPM_SMD
	default n
	help
          This option enables a driver which can read from a circular buffer
          of messages produced by the RPM. These messages provide diagnostic
          information about RPM operation. The driver outputs the messages
          via a debugfs node.

config MSM_RPM_STATS_LOG
        tristate "MSM Resource Power Manager Stat Driver"
        depends on DEBUG_FS
        depends on MSM_RPM_SMD
        default n
          help
          This option enables a driver which reads RPM messages from a shared
          memory location. These messages provide statistical information about
          the low power modes that RPM enters. The drivers outputs the message
          via a debugfs node.

config MSM_MPM_OF
	bool "Modem Power Manager"
	depends on OF
	help
	  MPM is a dedicated hardware resource responsible for entering and
	  waking up from a system wide low power mode. The MPM driver tracks
	  the wakeup interrupts and configures the MPM to monitor the wakeup
	  interrupts when going to a system wide sleep mode. This config option
	  enables the MPM driver that supports initialization from a device
	  tree

config MSM_SMEM
	depends on REMOTE_SPINLOCK_MSM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	  processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	  inter-processor communication.

config MSM_SMEM_LOGGING
	depends on MSM_SMEM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory Logger"
	help
	  Enable the shared memory logging to log the events between
	  the various processors in the system. This option exposes
	  the shared memory logger at /dev/smem_log and a debugfs node
	  named smem_log.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV2
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv2 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is
	  used by audio driver to configure QDSP6's
	  ASM, ADM and AFE.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv3 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is
	  used by audio driver to configure QDSP6v2's
	  ASM, ADM and AFE.

config MSM_ADSP_LOADER
	tristate "ADSP loader support"
	select SND_SOC_MSM_APRV2_INTF
	depends on MSM_QDSP6_APRV2 || MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	help
	  Enable ADSP image loader.
	  The ADSP loader brings ADSP out of reset
	  for the platforms that use APRv2.
	  Say M if you want to enable this module.

config MSM_MEMORY_DUMP
	bool "MSM Memory Dump Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.

config MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	bool "MSM Watchdog Support"
	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.

config MSM_WATCHDOG_CTX_PRINT
	bool "Print context dump saved by secure mode watchdog handler"
	default n
	depends on MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	help
	  After enabling this option, kernel will reserve bigger buffer
	  for secure mode watchdog handler to save info. And kernel will
	  try to print the info if it looks valid.
	  If unsure, say N

config MAXIMUM_CURRENT_THROTTLING
	tristate "CPU current throttling driver"
	help
	  Say Y to enable maximum current throttling.
	  The maximum current throttling driver enables application to
	  turn on/off CPU based current throttling by setting the
	  credit/upper limit in the CPU registers.
